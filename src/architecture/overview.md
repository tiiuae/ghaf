# Overview

The main architectural concept of the Ghaf platform is to break up the traditional monolithic structure to modularized components, virtual machines (VM). These VMs on hardened host OS implement the Ghaf edge virtualization platform. The Ghaf platform components are used in reference configurations to build images for reference devices. See [build configurations](../build_configurations.md) for more info.

See [architectural decisions record](architecture/adr.md) for more info on design choices that address architectural requirements.
