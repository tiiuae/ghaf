# This partition scheme contains three common partitions and ZFS pool.
# Some partitions are duplicated for the future AB SWupdate implementation.
#
# First two partitions are related to the boot process:
# - boot : Bootloader partition
# - ESP-A : (500M) Kernel and initrd
#
# ZFS datasets do not necessary need to have specified size and can be
# allocated dynamically. Quotas only restrict the maximum size of
# datasets, but do not reserve the space in the pool.
# The ZFS pool contains next datasets:
# - root : (30G) Root FS
# - vm-storage : (30G) Possible standalone pre-built VM images are stored here
# - reserved : (10G) Reserved dataset, no use
# - gp-storage : (50G) General purpose storage for some common insecure cases
# - recovery : (no quota) Recovery factory image is stored here
# - storagevm: (no quota) Dataset is meant to be used for StorageVM
