# Custom packages overlay

This overlay is for custom packages - new packages, like Gala, or
fixed/adjusted packages from nixpkgs. The overlay might be used as
an example and starting point for any other overlays.

## General Requirements

Use final/prev pair in your overlays instead of other variations
since it looks more logical:
previous (unmodified) package vs final (finalazed, adjusted) package.

Use deps[X][Y] variations instead of juggling dependencies between
nativeBuildInputs and buildInputs where possible.
It makes things clear and robust.

Divide overlays per package - each in its' own folder that is gets
imported via `default.nix`. This makes customized packages more
modular, improves maintainability and overlay reuse.
