# Custom packages overlay

This overlay is for custom packages - new packages, like Gala, or
fixed/adjusted packages from nixpkgs. The overlay might be used as
an example and starting point for any other overlays.

# Cross-compilation overlay

This overlay is for fixes regarding cross-compilation. It is maintained as a
separate overlay, because some of the changes might trigger heavy rebuilds of
packages in nixpkgs. It can then be separately added to cross-compilation
builds.

## General Requirements

Use final/prev pair in your overlays instead of other variations
since it looks more logical:
previous (unmodified) package vs final (finalazed, adjusted) package.

Use deps[X][Y] variations instead of juggling dependencies between
nativeBuildInputs and buildInputs where possible.
It makes things clear and robust.

# Upstream PR and commit tracking

Some patches are carried as overlays and others are patches that are cherry-picked
from staging and main into a tiiuae maintained version of nixpkgs
[tiiuae/nixpkgs/...](https://github.com/tiiuae/nixpkgs/)

The status of the integration in nixpkgs can be tracked using the [Pull Request Tracker](https://nixpk.gs/pr-tracker.html)
