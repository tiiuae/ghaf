## (WIP) Markdown Syntax

If you are new with Markdown, see [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

To make Markdown files maintainable over time and across teams, please follow the rules:

* Headings
  
    Add spacing to headings: two newlines before and one after.

* Line breaks (like in glossary)
* Code
* Lists
* Images
* Tables


## Managing Content

Use paragraphs to organize information in chapters, sections, and subsections.

To help others browse through content more effectively and make your topics clearer, follow the next guidelines:

* One idea per paragraph.
* Keep the number of sentences in each paragraph between 3 and 5. 
* The first two paragraphs in each topic must state the most important information.

Build each topic based on the following structure:
* First paragraph. Introduction, main idea. [1-2 paragraphs]
* Develop the idea, add details. [1 paragraph]
* More information, less important. [optional, 1 paragraph]
* Conclusion. Transition to the next paragraph. [1-2 sentences]


## Headings

Capitalize words in the heading according to the title case. 

> Title Case: You Capitalize All Words in the Title except for the Little Words.

In the Ghaf documentation, we do not use articles in headings.


## Plain English

Plain language is a universal language that makes information clear and better to understand.

* Use simple tenses.
* Write in an active voice.
* Understandable language, fewer gerunds.
* Short, sharp sentence. Try to use 15-20 words max.
* [Split information in paragraphs](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/tree/main/docs#managing-content).
* Do not use parenthesis for additional information, make a separate sentence instead.
* Use numbered lists for actions that happen in sequence.
* Do not contract the words: use _cannot_ instead of _canâ€™t_.


## Spelling and Punctuation

* We use standard United States (U.S.) English throughout all technical publications.

    In cases where US spelling differs from UK spelling, use the US spelling. There is no need to fix one by replacing it with the other. 

    For additional information, see [Manual of Style Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling) and [American and British English spelling differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences).
  
* Write the full name when first mentioned with the acronym in brackets: Supply Chain Security (SCS).
  
    For more information on abbreviation rules and appropriate usage of articles before abbreviations, see the [Glossary](https://tiiuae.github.io/ghaf/appendices/glossary.html) section of the Ghaf documentation.

* Use serial (Oxford) commas.
  
    The Oxford comma is a comma placed immediately before a coordinating conjunction (and, or) in a series of 3 or more items.

## References

For references (additional information on sections, terms and any other issues in a document that require supplementary explanation) use the following combination:
- for more information on X, see B 
- to learn how to X, see B
