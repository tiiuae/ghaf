title: Architectural Variants
---

The main scope of the Ghaf platform is edge virtualization. However, to support modular development and testing of the platform, variants are supported with the following definitions:

- `Default`  
   A default variant. Supports [minimal host](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/minimal-host), GUI VM[^note1] and [netvm](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/netvm). May host other VMs. For more information, see [Stack](/ghaf/overview/arch/stack).

- `Headless`  
   A variant with [minimal host](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/minimal-host) and [netvm](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/netvm). May host other VMs but does not have a GUI VM or graphics stack on a host.

- `Host only`
  A variant with [minimal host](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/minimal-host) _only_. A user can manually install software to a host, including VMs (if supported by hardware).

- `No virtualization`
  A variant for hardware with no support for virtualization. May run any software, similar to popular Linux distributions, but cannot support guest virtual machines. May host any software deployed directly on a host.

| Variant Name        | Headless  | Graphics       | VMs                               | Devices              |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `Default`           | No        | GUI VM         | Supported                         | Jetson, generic x86  |
| `Headless`          | Yes       | No             | Supported                         | Jetson, generic x86  |
| `Host Only`         | Yes       | No             | May be supported but not included | Jetson, generic x86  |
| `No Virtualization` | Yes or no | Native on host | Not supported                     | Raspberry Pi, RISC-V |

[^note1]: As of early 2023, the graphics stack is deployed on a host to support application development. Work is ongoing to define the GUI VM and isolate graphics with GPU passthrough.
