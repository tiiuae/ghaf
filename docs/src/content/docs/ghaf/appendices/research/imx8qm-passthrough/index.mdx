title: i.MX 8QM Ethernet Passthrough
---

The i.MX 8QuadMax (i.MX 8QM, iMX8QM, imx8qm) passthrough host setup relies as much as possible on the default i.MX 8QM MEK (imx8qm-mek) device tree configuration. Some guidance on what is required for passthrough to work on i.MX 8 can be found in the XEN device trees.

This document provides a detailed description of what has been done and why. For the more impatient readers, the example device tree files for i.MX 8QM guest and host with Ethernet passthrough are available here:

- Full host device tree: [imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts](/imx8qm-passthrough/imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts)
- Full guest device tree: [imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts](/imx8qm-passthrough/imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts)

**NOTE 20.12.2022:**
At the current state, the passthrough is not completely functional. The Ethernet device (fec1) or even both devices (fec1 and fec2) can be set up in the guest. The devices respond and seem functional, the device node does activate, the drivers load correctly, the power state of the device changes to active, and the link state of the Ethernet connection seems to change correctly. However, for some reason, no actual Ethernet data packages go through the Ethernet adapter. The most visible issue is that no interrupts come to the Ethernet devices.

## Host Kernel Configuration

Kernel version 5.10 was used during the setup. For the passthrough to work, a few kernel configuration options need to be added to the default i.MX 8QM configuration:

- CONFIG_VFIO_PLATFORM=y
- CONFIG_IOMMU_DEFAULT_PASSTHROUGH=y
- CONFIG_VFIO_PLATFORM=y
- CONFIG_ARM_SMMU_V3_SVA=y

## Host Device Tree Explained

The default Freescale i.MX 8QM MEK configuration is included and then updated to get the Ethernet device passthrough configuration added on top of the original device configuration.

There are two problems with using the i.MX 8 XEN configuration as a reference. The first issue is that the configuration between XEN and KVM do not map one to one. The second issue is more specific to Ethernet passthrough, as i.MX 8 XEN configuration does not set up passthrough for Ethernet so most of the configuration needs to be figured out from scratch.

```cpp
#include "freescale/imx8qm-mek.dts"

    domu {
        /*

### Other Notes About Passthrough

- All devices which belong to the same VFIO/IOMMU group need to be passed through to the guest.
- To prevent the device from being initialized by the host, change the device-compatible property to a dummy such as "fsl,dummy".
- The device status need needs to be "okay" for the device node to be available.
- If U-Boot finds devices that appear in the doma _rsrcs_ that contains the properties listed below, the device will get removed from the DTB:
  - power-domains
  - clocks
  - clock-names
  - assigned-clocks
  - assigned-clock-rates
  - pinctrl-0

## Changes in U-Boot

In our host device tree, we defined a couple of "rsrcs" resources to be handed over to the guest system. The ownership of these registers needs to be transferred to the guest after loading our device tree and before the actual boot. This can be done in U-Boot with a command:

```
scu_rm dtb ${fdt_addr}
```

The easiest way to accomplish this automatically during boot is to add the "scu_rm" to the default i.MX 8QM U-Boot "boot_os" command and save the changes as below:

```
setenv boot_os 'scu_rm dtb ${fdt_addr}; booti ${loadaddr} - ${fdt_addr};'
saveenv
```

## Running Platform Device Passthrough in QEMU

Before you start QEMU, the passedthrough devices need to be bind to the VFIO driver.

In some cases, the default driver needs to be unbind before the device can be bind to VFIO. However, in this case, all devices were changed to use the dummy device type in the device tree, so the step below is not required for this setup.

```sh
echo 5d1d0000.mailbox > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5d1d0000.mailbox/driver/unbind
echo 5b040000.ethernet > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b040000.ethernet/driver/unbind
echo 5b230000.clock-controller > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b230000.clock-controller/driver/unbind
```

The VFIO driver allows user-level access to the devices. Binding required devices to VFIO can be done as below:

```sh
    echo vfio-platform  > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5d1d0000.mailbox/driver_override
    echo 5d1d0000.mailbox > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind

    echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b040000.ethernet/driver_override
    echo 5b040000.ethernet > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind

    echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b230000.clock-controller/driver_override
    echo 5b230000.clock-controller > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind
```

After binding the devices to VFIO so it is possible to pass the devices to QEMU using "**-device vfio-platform**" arguments as below. The order in which the device arguments are given to QEMU may have an effect on some device properties such as interrupts.

```
-device vfio-platform,host=5b230000.clock-controller
-device vfio-platform,host=5b040000.ethernet
-device vfio-platform,host=5d1d0000.mailbox
```

## Guest Setup

Before starting the virtual machine with passed-through devices, we need to define our virtual machine device tree. One way of gaining a template for our QEMU device tree is by starting our QEMU instance and requesting a dump of its device tree in the DTB format as below.

DTB is a binary format of the device tree so we also need to use the command line tool device tree compiler **dtc** to convert the binary device tree to a more human-friendly device tree source format. Converting the device tree to source format may give a few warnings of missing or unrecognized properties and such but that is normal.

```sh
qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -M virt,gic-version=host,dumpdtb=virt.dtb -enable-kvm -nographic

# Convert binary to source device tree format
dtc -I dtb -O dts virt.dtb > virt.dts
```

This will provide a "**virt.dts**" file which can be used as a base for adding our passedthrough devices. The U-Boot device tree may change based on the U-Boot version, so the guest device tree may need some maintenance every now and then.

### Adding Devices to Guest

The platform devices which are going to get passed through should be added to the QEMU device tree **platform** bus section.

In this case, the main devices are **fec1**, **enet0_lpcg** and **lsio_mu2**. At the time of writing, the platform bus address in QEMU is "**c000000**" but that can be changed within the following code (needs recompiling QEMU) or it might change during some the QEMU code update.

```cpp
platform@c000000 {
  compatible = "qemu,platform\0simple-bus";
  interrupt-parent = <0x8001>;
  #address-cells = <0x02>;
  #size-cells = <0x02>;

```

The actual devices which were passed through may have some dependencies (such as clocks) which also need to be configured in the guest for the main devices to work properly. In most cases, they can be just copy-pasted from the original host configuration with a few minor alterations. Required dependencies need a bit of manual labor and depend on case to case.

The main key is to go through the whole original device tree and list out device node names that are used by the passedthrough devices. This may require several passes as the dependencies may also contain some dependencies of their own. On top of the requirements, it is good also to check if the passedthrough devices are used by some other devices.

Some devices may be used through a controller, such as **lsio_mu2** is used by the main system control unit **scu**. In this case, the dependencies consist of several clock devices and their controller and also the i.MX 8 system control unit **SCU** device with its internals.

The assisting devices can be added just before the start "**platform@c000000**" bus configuration section:

### Some Final Touches for Guest Devices

Now we have most of the actual devices setup. Some final modifications for individual devices can be done at the end of the guest device tree configuration. These can be done outside the main node, as we just modify some node properties which are already defined.

```cpp
    /**
     * For fec1 we need to update the interrupts to match the ones used by guest pass-through.
     * Most of the configuration is exactly the same that was set original imx8 config
     * Qemu starts its pass-through interrupts at 0x70 so lets change that
     * It is not strictly required to remove the possible iommus property but lets do that anyway
     */

With our additional devices also some headers and definitions need to be included at the beginning of the device tree. These additions can be found also from the original i.MX 8 device tree files. See the full device tree below for reference.

## Compiling the Device Tree Source to Binary Form

The device trees need to be compiled within the Linux kernel source directory. They depend on some kernel device tree headers and in the host device case—other device tree source files.

- Full host device tree: [imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts](/imx8qm-passthrough/imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts)
- Full guest device tree: [imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts](/imx8qm-passthrough/imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts)

### Compiling for Guest

```sh
cpp -nostdinc -I include -I arch  -undef -x assembler-with-cpp \
  arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dts.preprocessed; \
  dtc -I dts -O dtb -p 0x1000 imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.preprocessed -o imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dtb
```

### Compiling for Host

```sh
cpp -nostdinc -I include -I arch  -undef -x assembler-with-cpp \
  arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dts.preprocessed; \
  dtc -I dts -O dtb -p 0x1000 imx8qm-mek_conn-host.preprocessed -o imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dtb
```

## Running QEMU with Passthrough Platform Devices

To get passthrough working, i.MX 8 QM needs to be booted using our freshly built hosts **imx8qm-mek_conn-host.dtb** device tree file.

When the system has booted, we need to set up the passedthrough devices for the VFIO driver and start QEMU with devices passed through.

First, the devices need to be setup for VFIO:

```sh
echo vfio-platform  > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5d1d0000.mailbox/driver_override
echo 5d1d0000.mailbox > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind

echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b040000.ethernet/driver_override
echo 5b040000.ethernet > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind

echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5b230000.clock-controller/driver_override
echo 5b230000.clock-controller > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind
```

After, QEMU can be started with our devices over the devices.

This is just as an example. It may require a bit of change in other environments.

In this example, the guest kernel image—ext2 rootfs and guest device tree—all use the same filename prefix **imx8qm-mek_conn-guest**.

```sh
qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -M virt,gic-version=host -enable-kvm \
    -cpu host \
    -m 512M \
    -kernel "imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.Image" \
    -drive file="imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.ext2",if=virtio,format=raw -dtb "imx8qm-mek_conn-guest.dtb" \
    -nographic \
    -append "loglevel=7 rootwait root=/dev/vda console=ttyAMA0 earlycon earlyprintk" \
    -device vfio-platform,host=5b230000.clock-controller \
    -device vfio-platform,host=5b040000.ethernet \
    -device vfio-platform,host=5d1d0000.mailbox
```
