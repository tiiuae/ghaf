This is a glossary of terms and abbreviations developed by the Ghaf team.

**Abbreviation** is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually is used to save space and time, to avoid repetition of long words and phrases.

The styling of abbreviations is inconsistent and includes several possible variations. Some abbreviations are formed by omitting all but the first few letters of a word. Such abbreviations usually end in a period: Mr. for mister, Oct. for October.

When abbreviations are formed from the initial letters of a phrase, they are categorized as either **initialisms** or **acronyms**:

- With **initialisms**, each letter is pronounced separately. For example: FBI for Federal Bureau of Investigation, CIA for Central Intelligence Agency, CD for Compact Disk, and also OK for Okay, ‘orl korrekt‘ that is a misspelling of "all correct". Initialisms cannot be pronounced as words.

- **Acronyms** are another type of abbreviation formed from the initial letters but that are pronounced as if they were words themselves. For example: ROFL for ‘rolling on the floor laughing’, FEMA for Federal Emergency Management Agency, NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

All acronyms are abbreviations, but not all abbreviations are acronyms. ASAP that comes from ‘as soon as possible’ and appt (for appointment) are both considered abbreviations, but only ASAP is an acronym.

### Appropriate Use of Articles before Abbreviations

- Articles (a, an, the) are common with initialisms. The indefinite article should be chosen according to the first sound—not the first letter:
  - ‘A’ is correct before initialisms beginning with a consonant sound, including a vowel pronounced as a ‘w’ or ‘y’ sound. For example: ‘a NASA launch’, but ‘NASA launches take place’.
  - When an initialism begins with a vowel sound (including silent consonants or a consonant pronounced with an initial vowel sound), ‘an’ should be used instead. For example, ‘read about an FBI raid’.
- Acronyms not require articles except when they are used adjectivally. For example: ‘the patient was diagnosed with AIDS’, but ‘the AIDS patient’; ‘the NASA launch takes place’.

So, read the abbreviation aloud: it may be either an initialism or an acronym. Focus on the sounds, not on the letters: ‘_an_ unidentified flying object’ but ‘_a_ UFO’ as it pronounced “a YOO-ef-OH” (/ˌjuːɛfˈəʊ/). More examples: a EULA (“YOO-luh”), a LAN router, an XML file, an HTML page.

### Trivia

If you do not find the term or abbreviation you are looking for, share your questions using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/issues).
