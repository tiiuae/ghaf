title: Compartmentalization
---

Compartmentalization is the technique of separating parts of a system to decrease attack surface and prevent malfunctions from cascading in the system. In Ghaf architecture, there is a separate VM for every vital function of the system.

Current implementation supports GUI VM, [Networking VM](/ghaf/overview/arch/adr/netvm) and a couple of Application VMs, such as the Chromium web browser and the Zathura document viewer.

The GUI VM owns a computer's GPU and performs desktop environment and application windows rendering. Wayland protocol for applications in this case is proxified by `waypipe` over SSH. This approach is used temporarily before moving to more sophisticated solutions.

A VM compartmentalization requires all necessary devices passthrough in place. More specifically, you need to know the PCI VID and PID of a device and also its number on the PCI bus. In the case of a USB device passthrough, it is enough to know the device's VID and PID.

For more information on actual implementation, see [Ghaf as Library](/ghaf/dev/library) and [Creating Application VM](/ghaf/dev/ref/creating_appvm).
