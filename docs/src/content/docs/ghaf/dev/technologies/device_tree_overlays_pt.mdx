title: Device Tree Overlays for Passthrough
---

The device tree blob (DTB) is a data structure that describes the hardware
components of a particular system so that the operating system can use and manage
those components. For passthrough, the hardware description in the host needs
some modifications, which include:

- Removing the device's driver to passthrough by assigning a dummy string
  to the _compatible_ property.
- Adding the _iommus_ property to the device to passthrough.
- Removing or adding other properties that cause conflicts during the passthrough.

Modifying the host device tree could be done by applying patches
to DTS files. Nevertheless, this option is not
scalable if we need to apply different patches to the same .dts from
different configurations.

A better and more scalable approach for modifying a device tree is using device
tree overlays. The device tree overlay contains information about the nodes
to modify (in nodes called _fragment@0 ..._) and the overlay of the
properties that we want to affect. For more information on the overlays,
see [Overlay notes](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/overlay-notes.txt).

## Nix hardware.deviceTree Module

The Nix hardware.deviceTree module helps to work with the device trees and
their overlays:

- To define the device tree overlay file to use.
- To use a filter to apply the overlay only to specific files.
- To define included paths to build the device tree overlay.

## Device Tree Overlay Example

In this section, you can find an example of an overlay for the UARTI passthrough.
Suppose that we want to passthrough the UARTI to a VM. To do this, we need
to modify and add these properties:

- **compatible:** put a dummy driver associated with this node so that
  the kernel will not bind any driver to this UART unit.
- **iommus:** add the iommus field with the test stream ID
  _TEGRA_SID_NISO1_SMMU_TEST_ which by default is not used by any other device

The original properties of the UARTI in Nvidia Jetson Orin AGX are defined in
_hardware/nvidia/soc/t23x/kernel-dts/tegra234-soc/tegra234-soc-uart.dtsi_
as follows:

```cpp
    uarti: serial@31d0000 {
        compatible = "arm,dummy";
        iommus = <&smmu_niso0 TEGRA_SID_NISO1_SMMU_TEST>;
        reg = <0x0 0x31d0000 0x0 0x10000>;
        interrupts = <0x0 TEGRA234_IRQ_UARTI 0x04>;
        current-speed = <115200>;
        status = "disabled";
    };
```

We have defined an overlay as follows for the passthrough:

```cpp

 * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022-2026 TII (SSRC) and the Ghaf contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0
 */

/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

#include <dt-bindings/memory/tegra234-smmu-streamid.h>

/{
    overlay-name = "UARTI passthrough on host";
    compatible = "nvidia,p3737-0000+p3701-0000";

    fragment@0 {
        target = <&uarti>;
        __overlay__ {
            compatible = "arm,dummy";
            iommus = <&smmu_niso0 TEGRA_SID_NISO1_SMMU_TEST>;
            status = "okay";
        };
    };
};
```

We will describe here all the components:

- **`#include <dt-bindings/memory/tegra234-smmu-streamid.h>`:** the
  included headers files for the macro definitions used in the device
  tree overlay.

- **`overlay-name`:** briefly describes the purpose of the device tree

- **`compatible`:** this must be at least one of the root (/) compatibles of
  the source device tree that we want to overlay, because the
  _hardware.deviceTree_ module will apply only to each .dtb file matching
  "compatible" of the overlay.

- **`fragment@0`:** node with the information of the source node to
  modify.

- **`fragment@0/target`:** label to the node to modify.
  For this case we can use the label _uarti_, but also we can use
  the path with path: _target-path="/serial@31d0000"_

- **`__overlay__`:** contains the properties that we want to add or modify from
  the source node.

In Nix you can enable the hardware.deviceTree module and define the device
tree path as follows:

```nix
# Enable hardware.deviceTree for handle host dtb overlays
hardware.deviceTree.enable = true;

# Apply the device tree overlay only to tegra234-p3701-host-passthrough.dtb
hardware.deviceTree.overlays = [
    {
    name = "uarti_pt_host_overlay";
    dtsFile = ./uarti_pt_host_overlay.dts;

    # Apply overlay only to host passthrough device tree
    filter = "tegra234-p3701-host-passthrough.dtb";
    }
];
```

Also, in `jetson-orin.nix` the _dtboBuildExtraIncludePaths_ is defined with the
path needed to include the _tegra234-smmu-streamid.h_ header file.

```nix
hardware.deviceTree =
{
    enable = lib.mkDefault true;
    # Add the include paths to build the dtb overlays
    dtboBuildExtraIncludePaths = [
    "${lib.getDev config.hardware.deviceTree.kernelPackage}/lib/modules/${config.hardware.deviceTree.kernelPackage.modDirVersion}/source/nvidia/soc/t23x/kernel-include"
    ];
}
```

You can find this full implementation in the Nix module `uarti-net-vm`.
