title: Hardware acceleration in Linux
---

Hardware acceleration refers to offloading certain tasks, typically graphical or computational, from the CPU to specialized hardware components like the GPU, video decoder/encoder, or other accelerators. This can greatly improve system performance and efficiency, especially for graphics rendering, video playback, and certain compute-heavy applications.

### Types of Hardware Acceleration

1. **GPU Acceleration (Graphics)**

- Used for rendering GUIs, 3D applications or desktops like [labwc](https://github.com/labwc/labwc), [cosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch).

- APIs involved:
  - **OpenGL / Vulkan**
  - **Mesa 3D** (open-source graphics library)

2. **Video Acceleration (Decode/Encode)**

- Useful for smooth playback of high-definition video.

- Libraries/interfaces:
  - **VA-API (Video Acceleration API)** ‚Äì Intel, AMD
  - **VDPAU** (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) ‚Äì NVIDIA
  - **NVDEC / NVENC** ‚Äì NVIDIA proprietary decoding/encoding
  - **V4L2 (Video4Linux)** ‚Äì General video capture/encode API

3. **Compute Acceleration**

- Used in AI, ML, and general purpose GPU computing.

- Technologies:
  - **OpenCL** (open standard)
  - **CUDA** (NVIDIA-specific)

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Check If It's Enabled

1. **GPU Info**

   ```sh
   glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
   ```

2. **Video Acceleration Check**

   ```sh
   vainfo      # For VA-API

   vdpauinfo   # For VDPAU
   ```

3. **GPU workload check**

   ```sh
   intel_gpu_top # For Intel Platforms

   nvidia-smi    # For Nvidia Platforms
   ```

4. **General Acceleration**

- Monitor CPU usage during video playback using `htop` or `top`.

- If CPU usuage is low, hardware acceleration is likely working.

### üé• Video hardware acceleration support in browsers

1. For Firefox

   - In URL type following:

     ```sh
     about:support # Then scroll down to find Media section to find Codecs supported with Hardware Decoding
     ```

2. For Chrome

   - In URL type following:

     ```sh
     chrome://gpu # Then scroll down to bottom to find `Video Acceleration Information`
     ```
