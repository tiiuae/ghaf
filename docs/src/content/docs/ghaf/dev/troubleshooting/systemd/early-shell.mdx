title: Early Shell
---

In some cases, the system may fail to boot due to the failure of a critical service. If this happens, you can follow these steps to diagnose the issue with systemd services:

1. [Increase the systemd log level](/ghaf/dev/troubleshooting/systemd/system-log) using the previously mentioned option, and load the image.

2. Reboot the system. As expected, you will encounter a boot failure.

3. Force reboot the machine. When the machine starts again, interrupt the bootloader and add the following to the bootloader command line:

   ```
   rescue systemd.setenv=SYSTEMD_SULOGIN_FORCE=1
   ```

   To modify the bootloader command, select the boot option and then press the `e` key.

4. You will now enter an early shell environment. Here, you can access the logs from the previous boot using `journalctl`. The logs will help you identify any service failures.
