title: Debugging systemd Using systemctl
---

To debug failed services using `systemctl`:

1. List failed services in the system:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl --failed
   ```

   You will get a list of failed services. To see a list of all the services in the system, use the command:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
   ```

2. Check status of the failed service for more detailed information:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status <service_name>.service
   ```

3. See the service logs for more insight:

   ```sh
   sudo journalctl -b -u <service_name>.service
   ```

4. You can further increase the log level to get debug level information:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl log-level debug
   ```

   Reload the systemd daemon and restart a service:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart  <service_name>.service
   ```

   Now you can see debug level information in the service log.

5. You can also attach `strace` with the service daemon to see system call and signal status:

   - Get the PID of the main process from service status. It is listed as `Main PID:`.
   - Attach strace with the PID:

     ```sh
     sudo strace -f -s 100 -p <Main_PID>
     ```

6. Retune the service configuration in runtime:

   ```sh
   systemctl edit --runtime <service_name>.service
   ```

   - Uncomment the `[Service]` section and the configuration you want to enable or disable. You can add any new configuration. This basically overrides your base configuration.
   - Save the configuration as `/run/systemd/system/<service_name>.d/override.conf`.
   - Reload the systemd daemon and restart the service as mentioned in step 4.
   - You can check if your service is using the new configuration with the command:

     ```sh
     sudo systemctl show <service_name>.service
     ```

   - For checking the base configuration:

     ```sh
     sudo systemctl cat <service_name>.service
     ```

7. If the new configuration works for you, you can check the exposure level of the service using the command:

   ```sh
   systemd-analyze security
   systemd-analyze security <service_name>.service #For detailed information
   ```

8. Update the configuration in the Ghaf repository and build it. Hardened service configs are available in the directory [`ghaf/modules/common/systemd/hardened-configs`](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/tree/main/modules/common/systemd/hardened-configs).
