title: Ghaf Kill Switch
description: CLI tool to list, block and unblock microphone, network and camera devices in Ghaf.
---

## Overview

`ghaf-killswitch` is a command-line utility in Ghaf that enables runtime toggling of certain hardware devices.
It supports listing known devices, disabling (blocking) them, and re-enabling (unblocking) them.
This capability is useful for privacy control, resource isolation or dynamic hardware management within the Ghaf host/VM architecture.

It currently supports three device types:

| Keyword | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mic`  | Internal Audio & microphone PCI devices (used by the `audio-vm`) |
| `net`  | WLAN / network PCI device (used by the `net-vm`) |
| `cam`  | Internal camera device (used by the `business-vm`) |
| `bluetooth`  | Bluetooth device (used by the `audio-vm`) |

> Note: Some hardware platforms may already include a physical camera kill switch (e.g. via Fn-key) which overrides software control.

## Usage & Commands

Run `ghaf-killswitch` to control devices. General usage:

```sh
[ghaf@ghaf-host:~]$ sudo ghaf-killswitch <command> [device]
```

Where `<command>` is:

* `list` — show all supported devices for kill switch functionality
* `block <device>` — disable / remove the specified device
* `unblock <device>` — enable / add the specified device
* `block --all`      - disable / remove all supported devices
* `unblock --all`   - enable / add all supported devices
* `status` - Show block/unblock status of devices
* `help` — show usage instructions

### Examples

#### List devices

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch list
```

#### Disable internal microphone

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch block mic
```

Run the below command to confirm:

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ nix-shell -p pulseaudio --run "pactl list sources short"
```

#### Disable Wi-Fi

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch block net
```

Check inside `net-vm` or GUI to confirm:

```bash
[ghaf@net-vm:~]$ nmcli device status
```

#### Disable internal camera

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch block cam
```

Check inside `business-vm` to confirm:

```bash
[ghaf@business-vm:~]$ lsusb
```

#### Disable Bluetooth

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch block bluetooth
```

Check inside `audio-vm` to confirm:

```bash
[ghaf@business-vm:~]$ lsusb
```

#### Check status of devices

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch status
mic: unblocked
net: unblocked
cam: blocked
bluetooth: blocked
```
#### Disable all devices

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch block --all
```

#### Re-enable all devices

```bash
[ghaf@gui-vm:~]$ ghaf-killswitch unblock --all
```

## Limitations & Known Issues
- GUI anomalies — audio UI elements may misbehave when mic is disabled.
- Disabling the microphone will stop only internal audio playback and audio recording functionality.
- Support for blocking external USB devices like camera, microphone is currently unavailable.
