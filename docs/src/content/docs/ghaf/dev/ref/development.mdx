Ghaf Framework is free software, currently under active development.

Once you are up and running, you can participate in the collaborative development process by building a development build with additional options. For example, with the development username and password that are defined in [accounts.nix](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/blob/main/modules/common/users/accounts.nix).

If you authorize your development SSH keys in the [ssh.nix](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/blob/main/modules/common/development/authorized_ssh_keys.nix#L4-L21) module and rebuild Ghaf for your target device, you can use `nixos-rebuild switch` to quickly deploy your configuration changes to the target device over the network using SSH. For example:

```sh
nixos-rebuild --flake .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug --target-host root@<ip_address_of_ghaf-host> --fast switch
nixos-rebuild --flake .#lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-debug --target-host root@<ip_address_of_ghaf-host> --fast switch
```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="tip">
  With the `-debug` targets, the debug ethernet is enabled on host. With Lenovo
  X1 Carbon, you can connect USB-Ethernet adapter for the debug and development
  access.
