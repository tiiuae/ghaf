title: Ghaf VMs Status Tool
description: CLI tool to monitor and manage MicroVM status in Ghaf.
---

## Overview

`ghaf-vms` is a command-line utility in Ghaf that provides real-time status information about running MicroVMs on the host system. It queries systemd to determine the state of each configured MicroVM and displays the information in a color-coded, easy-to-read format.

This tool is particularly useful for:
- Checking which VMs are running or stopped
- Debugging VM startup issues
- Monitoring the overall health of the MicroVM architecture
- Quick system status overview without navigating through systemd commands

---

## Usage & Commands

Run `ghaf-vms` on the Ghaf host to view VM status. General usage:

```sh
[ghaf@ghaf-host:~]$ ghaf-vms [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

* `-l` — List all configured MicroVMs and their current status (default behavior)
* `-h` — Show usage instructions

### Examples

#### List all VMs and their status

```bash
[ghaf@ghaf-host:~]$ ghaf-vms -l
```

Or simply:

```bash
[ghaf@ghaf-host:~]$ ghaf-vms
```

Example output:

```
  VM Status:
  =========
  audio-vm: running
  business-vm: running
  chrome-vm: running
  gui-vm: running
  ids-vm: running
  net-vm: running
  zathura-vm: stopped
```

### Status Indicators

The tool displays VMs with color-coded status indicators:

| Status | Color | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `RUNNING` | Green | VM is currently active and running |
| `STOPPED` | Red | VM is configured but not running |
| `FAILED` | Bold Red | VM service failed to start |
| `ACTIVATING` | Yellow | VM is in the process of starting |
| Other states | Cyan | VM is in another systemd state (e.g., deactivating, reloading) |
