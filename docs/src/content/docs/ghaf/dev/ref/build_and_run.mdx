title: Build and Run
---

This tutorial assumes that you already have basic [git](https://git-scm.com/) experience and are working on a Linux system.

The canonical URL for the upstream Ghaf git repository is https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf. To try Ghaf, you can build it from the source.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="tip">
  **Cross-compilation support**: Ghaf fully supports cross-compilation for AArch64 targets! All ARM64 targets have corresponding `-from-x86_64` variants that can be built on x86_64 development machines. See [Cross-compilation Guide](/ghaf/dev/ref/cross_compilation) for details.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  **Build Time Information**:
  - **With binary cache** (default): 5-30 minutes for most targets
  - **First build from source**: 45-180 minutes depending on target
  - **Recommended**: Use Ghaf binary cache for fastest builds

  Configure binary cache: `nix build --option substituters "https://ghaf-dev.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org"`
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (NixOS recommended, but Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora also work)
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (for building all targets including cross-compilation to AArch64)
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 20GB free space
- **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for downloading dependencies and binary cache

### Required Software Installation

1. **Clone the Ghaf repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf.git
   cd ghaf
   ```

2. **Install Nix Package Manager** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
   ```

3. **Enable Nix Flakes** by adding to your nix configuration:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
   echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   ```

4. **Configure Binary Cache** for faster builds:
   ```sh
   # Add to ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   echo "substituters = https://ghaf-dev.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   echo "trusted-public-keys = ghaf-dev.cachix.org-1:S3M8x3no8LFQPBfHw1jl6nmP8A7cVWKntoMKN3IsEQY= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   ```

5. **Verify your setup** by viewing available targets:
   ```sh
   nix flake show
   ```

## Quick Start: Primary Build Targets

### Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11 (Recommended for x86_64)

This is the primary reference device for Ghaf on x86_64 architecture.

1. **Build the image** (5-15 minutes with binary cache, 60-120 minutes from source):
   ```sh
   nix build .#lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-debug
   ```

2. **Prepare USB boot media**:
   ```sh
   ./packages/pkgs-by-name/flash-script/flash.sh -d /dev/<YOUR_USB_DRIVE> -i result/ghaf-lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-debug.img
   ```

   ⚠️ **Warning**: Replace `<YOUR_USB_DRIVE>` with your actual USB device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`). This will erase all data on the USB drive.

3. **Boot from USB**: Insert the USB drive and boot your Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11 from the USB device.

### NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin (Primary AArch64 target)

This is the primary reference device for Ghaf on AArch64 architecture, built using cross-compilation.

1. **Build flash script** (10-30 minutes with binary cache, 90-180 minutes from source):
   ```sh
   # For 32GB AGX version (cross-compiled):
   nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-from-x86_64-flash-script

   # For 32GB AGX with generic LUKS passphrase rootfs encryption:
   nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-luks-from-x86_64-flash-script

   # For 64GB AGX version (cross-compiled):
   nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-debug-from-x86_64-flash-script
   ```

2. **Set up hardware connections**:
   - Connect power supply via USB-C
   - Connect host computer to Jetson via USB-C (for flashing)
   - Connect Micro-USB cable for serial console access

3. **Put device in recovery mode**: See [NVIDIA's Force Recovery Mode guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-agx-orin-devkit-user-guide/howto.html#force-recovery-mode)

4. **Flash the device**:
   ```sh
   cd result
   sudo ./flash.sh
   ```

   For `*-luks-*` targets, use the legacy flashing entrypoint so rootfs can be
   encrypted before APP is written:

   ```sh
   sudo ./result/bin/flash-ghaf-host
   ```

   This prompts for a shared LUKS passphrase, encrypts the extracted root image,
   and then flashes it. On boot, initrd prompts for the same passphrase.

## Alternative Build Targets

## Virtual Machine (For Testing)

Before building for physical hardware, you can test Ghaf in a virtual machine:

1. **Run VM directly** (5-15 minutes with binary cache, 45-90 minutes from source):
   ```sh
   nix run .#packages.x86_64-linux.vm-debug
   ```

This creates a `ghaf-host.qcow2` overlay disk image in your current directory. For a clean shutdown, use the QEMU menu: Machine → Power Down.

## Build Time Optimization

### Using Binary Cache (Recommended)
Ghaf provides pre-built binaries through a binary cache, dramatically reducing build times:

```sh
# Build with binary cache (default configuration)
nix build .#lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-debug

# Explicitly specify binary cache
nix build .#lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-debug \
  --option substituters "https://ghaf-dev.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org"
```

### Expected Build Times

| Target Type | With Binary Cache | From Source |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **x86_64 targets** | 5-15 minutes | 60-120 minutes |
| **AArch64 cross-compiled** | 10-30 minutes | 90-180 minutes |
| **VM targets** | 3-10 minutes | 45-90 minutes |
| **Installer images** | 8-20 minutes | 90-150 minutes |

### Cross-Compilation Benefits
- **No ARM64 hardware needed**: Build AArch64 targets on x86_64 development machines
- **Faster than emulation**: True cross-compilation is faster than QEMU emulation
- **CI/CD friendly**: Standard x86_64 infrastructure can build ARM64 targets

## Ghaf Image for NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX

Before you begin:

- Check device-independent [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
- If you use a new device, [flash bootloader firmware](#flashing-nvidia-jetson-orin-agx) first. Then you can [build and run a Ghaf image](#building-and-running-ghaf-image-for-nvidia-jetson-orin-agx).

#### Flashing NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX

1. Run the command:

   ```sh
   nix build github:tiiuae/ghaf#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-flash-script
   ```

   The above command is for AGX 32GB version. For the AGX 64GB RAM version please
   use:

   ```sh
   nix build github:tiiuae/ghaf#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-debug-flash-script
   ```

   It will build the Ghaf image and bootloader firmware, and prepare the flashing script. Give "yes" answers to all script questions. The building process takes around 1,5 hours.

2. Set up the following connections:

   1. Connect the board to a power supply with a USB-C cable.
   2. Connect a Linux laptop to the board with the USB-C cable.
   3. Connect the Linux laptop to the board with a Micro-USB cable to use [serial interface](https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php/NVIDIA_Jetson_Orin/In_Board/Getting_in_Board/Serial_Console).

   > For more information on the board's connections details, see the [Hardware Layout](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-agx-orin-devkit-user-guide/developer_kit_layout.html) section of the Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit User Guide.

3. After the build is completed, put the board in recovery mode. For more information, see the [Force Recovery](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-agx-orin-devkit-user-guide/howto.html#force-recovery-mode) Mode section in the Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit User Guide.

4. Run the flashing script:

   ```sh
   sudo ~/result/bin/flash-ghaf-host
   ```

   There is a time-out for this operation, so run the script within one minute after putting the device in recovery mode. If you got the error message "ERROR: might be timeout in USB write.":

   1. Reboot the device and put it in recovery mode again.
   2. Check with the `lsusb` command if your computer can still recognize the board, and run the flash script again.

5. Restart the device after flashing is done.

#### Building and Running Ghaf Image for NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX

After the latest firmware is [flashed](#flashing-nvidia-jetson-orin-agx), it is possible to use a simplified process by building only the Ghaf disk image and running it from external media:

1. To build the target image, run the command:
   ```sh
   nix build github:tiiuae/ghaf#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-from-x86_64
   ```
   The above command is for AGX 32GB version. For the AGX 64GB RAM version please
   use:
   ```sh
   nix build github:tiiuae/ghaf#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-debug
   ```
2. After the build is completed, prepare a USB boot media with the target image you built using the `flash.sh` script:
   ```sh
   ./packages/flash/flash.sh -d /dev/<YOUR_USB_DRIVE> -i result/sd-image/<IMAGE_NAME>
   ```
3. Boot the hardware from the USB media.

In the current state of Ghaf, it is a bit tricky to make NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX boot Ghaf from a USB if the same thing has already been flashed on the boards's eMMC. To succeed, you can change partition labels on eMMC (or optionally wiping everything away by formatting):

1. Log in as a root:
   ```sh
   sudo su
   ```
2. Check the current labels:
   ```sh
   lsblk -o name,path,fstype,mountpoint,label,size,uuid
   ```
3. Change the ext4 partition label:
   ```sh
   e2label /dev/mmcblk0p1 nixos_emmc
   ```
4. Change the vfat partition label:
   ```sh
   dosfslabel /dev/mmcblk0p2 ESP_EMMC
   ```
5. Verify the labels that were changed:
   ```sh
   lsblk -o name,path,fstype,mountpoint,label,size,uuid
   ```
6. After these changes NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX cannot boot from its internal eMMC. It will boot from the USB device with the correct partition labels.
