<Aside type="note">
  Cross-compilation support has significantly improved! All targets with `-from-x86_64` suffix are cross-compiled from x86_64 to their target architecture and are fully supported.
</Aside>

Ghaf is targeted at a range of devices and form factors that support different instruction set architectures (ISA). Many small form-factor edge devices are not powerful enough to compile the needed applications or OSs that run on them. As the most common ISA used in desktops and servers is `x86_64`, this requires cross-compilation for target ISAs such as `AArch64`.

NixOS and Nixpkgs have excellent support for cross-compilation, and Ghaf leverages this extensively for ARM64 targets.

## Cross-Compilation Targets

All Ghaf targets with the `-from-x86_64` suffix are cross-compiled from x86_64 host systems to their target architecture. These are the recommended targets for building AArch64 systems from x86_64 development machines.

### NVIDIA Jetson Platform (Primary AArch64 Targets)

The NVIDIA Jetson family represents Ghaf's primary AArch64 platform with full cross-compilation support:

#### Jetson AGX Orin (32GB)
```sh
# Debug variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-luks-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-nodemoapps-from-x86_64

# Release variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-release-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-release-nodemoapps-from-x86_64

# Flash script generation
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-from-x86_64-flash-script
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-luks-from-x86_64-flash-script
```

#### Jetson AGX Orin (64GB)
```sh
# Debug variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-debug-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-debug-nodemoapps-from-x86_64

# Release variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-release-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx64-release-nodemoapps-from-x86_64
```

#### Jetson Orin NX
```sh
# Debug variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-nx-debug-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-nx-debug-nodemoapps-from-x86_64

# Release variants
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-nx-release-from-x86_64
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-nx-release-nodemoapps-from-x86_64
```

### NXP i.MX Platform (Secondary AArch64 Target)

```sh
# Debug variant
nix build .#nxp-imx8mp-evk-debug-from-x86_64

# Release variant
nix build .#nxp-imx8mp-evk-release-from-x86_64
```

## Cross-Compilation Benefits

### Performance
- **Faster builds**: Leverage powerful x86_64 development machines
- **Consistent environment**: Use familiar development tools and IDEs
- **CI/CD integration**: Build ARM64 targets in standard x86_64 CI infrastructure

### Development Workflow
- **No hardware dependency**: Build ARM64 targets without ARM64 hardware
- **Remote building**: Use remote builders for consistent cross-compilation
- **Reproducible builds**: Identical output regardless of build host

## Setting Up Cross-Compilation

### Prerequisites

For cross-compilation to work properly, ensure your development environment has:

1. **Sufficient resources**: Cross-compilation can be resource-intensive
   - Minimum 16GB RAM recommended
   - Fast NVMe storage preferred
   - Multiple CPU cores for parallel builds

2. **Network access**: Download dependencies and use binary caches
   ```sh
   # Configure Ghaf binary cache for faster builds
   nix build --option substituters "https://ghaf-dev.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org"
   ```

### Remote Builder Setup (Optional)

For consistent cross-compilation across teams, consider setting up remote builders:

```nix
# In /etc/nixos/configuration.nix or ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
builders = @/etc/nix/machines
builders-use-substitutes = true
```

See [Remote Build Setup](/ghaf/dev/ref/remote_build_setup) for detailed configuration.

## Native vs Cross-Compiled Builds

### Target Naming Convention

- **Native builds**: `nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug` (built on/for same architecture)
- **Cross-compiled builds**: `nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug-from-x86_64` (built on x86_64 for AArch64)

### When to Use Each

**Use cross-compilation (`-from-x86_64`) when:**
- Building on x86_64 development machines (most common)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Need faster build times
- Don't have native AArch64 hardware for building

**Use native builds when:**
- Building directly on target hardware
- Debugging hardware-specific issues
- Final validation on actual hardware

## Troubleshooting Cross-Compilation

### Common Issues

**Build failures with missing dependencies:**
```sh
# Clear Nix store and retry
nix store gc
nix build .#target --rebuild
```

**Slow builds:**
```sh
# Use binary cache and parallel builds
nix build .#target \
  --option substituters "https://ghaf-dev.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org" \
  --option max-jobs 8
```

**Memory issues:**
```sh
# Limit parallel jobs to reduce memory usage
nix build .#target --option max-jobs 2
```

### Build Time Expectations

Cross-compilation build times for AArch64 targets:
- **NVIDIA Jetson targets**: 90-180 minutes (first build)
- **NXP i.MX targets**: 60-120 minutes (first build)
- **Subsequent builds**: 5-30 minutes (with binary cache)

## Next Steps

- See [Build and Run Guide](/ghaf/dev/ref/build_and_run) for complete build instructions
- Check [Remote Build Setup](/ghaf/dev/ref/remote_build_setup) for distributed builds
- Review [NVIDIA Jetson Hardware Guide](/ghaf/dev/ref/hw-config) for hardware-specific details

## binfmt Emulated Build (Alternative Method)

For targets that do not have full cross-compilation support or when debugging architecture-specific issues, [binfmt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc) provides an alternative approach by allowing execution of different ISA binaries on your development machine through emulation.

### How binfmt Works

binfmt enables running target architecture binaries in an emulator such as `QEMU`. While not true cross-compilation, this allows building for different architectures when cross-compilation is not available or when you need to debug architecture-specific behavior.

### Setting Up binfmt

To enable `binfmt`, add the following to your host system's `configuration.nix`:

```nix
boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [
  "aarch64-linux"
];
```

For optimal performance, also enable KVM support:

**For AMD processors:**
```nix
boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-amd" ];
```

**For Intel processors:**
```nix
boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-intel" ];
```

### When to Use binfmt

**Use binfmt emulation when:**
- Cross-compilation targets are not available (`-from-x86_64` variants don't exist)
- Debugging architecture-specific issues
- Testing compatibility with target architecture
- Working with packages that don't support cross-compilation

**Performance considerations:**
- **Slower than cross-compilation**: Emulation overhead can be significant
- **Higher resource usage**: QEMU emulation requires more CPU and memory
- **Build times**: Expect 2-4x longer build times compared to native or cross-compilation

### Example Usage

With binfmt configured, you can build native AArch64 targets on x86_64:

```sh
# Build native AArch64 targets (emulated on x86_64)
nix build .#nvidia-jetson-orin-agx-debug
nix build .#nxp-imx8mp-evk-debug

# This works through binfmt emulation when built on x86_64
```

### binfmt vs Cross-Compilation

| Method | Performance | Compatibility | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Cross-compilation** | Fast | High | Primary method for supported targets |
| **binfmt emulation** | Slower | Universal | Fallback for unsupported targets |

**Recommendation**: Always prefer cross-compilation (`-from-x86_64` targets) when available, and use binfmt emulation only for targets without cross-compilation support.
