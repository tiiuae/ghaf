title: Running Remote Build on NixOS
---

To set up a remote build on NixOS:

1. Identify required SSH keys for remote SSH connection.
2. Set up configurations.

If you hit an issue, check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### 1. Configuring SSH Keys

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside>
  This step assumes that public SSH keys were generated and copied
  (*ssh-copy-id*) both for normal and root users. For more information, see
  [Setting up public key
  authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id#setting-up-public-key-authentication).
</Aside>

Before you begin, make sure an SSH connection is established to the remote host for both normal and root users:

```sh
ssh USER@IP_ADDRESS_OF_REMOTE_MACHINE
nix store ping --store ssh://USER@REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS
```

#### 1.1. [Local Machine] Configuring SSH Keys

Do the following on a local machine:

1. Change directory to Home Directory with SSH:

   ```sh
   cd .ssh
   ```

   The public keys of the remote machine are located in the _known_hosts_ file. These keys are created and configured after the _ssh-copy-id_ command. Make sure the keys are there. If they are not there:

   1. Access the remote machine.
   2. Run `cd /etc/ssh`.
   3. Retrieve and copy the public keys.
   4. Go back to the local machine and paste them into _known_hosts_.

2. Navigate to the `/etc/ssh/` directory:

   ```sh
   cd /etc/ssh
   ```

   Make sure the _ssh_known_hosts_ file contains the same public keys as the remote machine (same as `.ssh/knwon_hosts`). Otherwise, specify it in the `configuration.nix` file.

3. Use CMD as the root user:
   ```sh
   sudo -i
   ```
4. Make sure the root user’s keys are different from the user’s keys:
   ```sh
   cd .ssh
   ```
   > `.ssh` is a user-level access and `/etc/ssh` is system-wide.

#### 1.2. Accessing Remote Machine Using SSH

Do the following:

1. Navigate the _authorized_keys_ file:
   ```sh
   ssh USER@IP_ADDRESS_OF_REMOTE_MACHINE
   cd .ssh
   sudo nano authorized_keys
   ```
2. Make sure that both user and root public keys for the local machine are located there:

   - The user’s public key can be obtained from `/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
   - The root user's public key can be obtained from `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

### 2. Setting Up Configuration Files

#### 2.1. [Local Machine] Setting Up Configuration Files

Do the following on a local machine:

1. Set configuration variables in `configuration.nix` and `nix.conf`:
   1. Use the following commands:
      ```sh
      cd /etc/nixos
      sudo nano configuration.nix
      ```
   2. Add lib in the header like so: `{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:`.
   3. Edit the `nix.conf` file:
      ```nix
      environment.etc."nix/nix.conf".text = lib.mkForce ''
          # Your custom nix.conf content here
          builders = @/etc/nix/machines
          require-sigs = false
          max-jobs = 0 # to use remote build by default not local
          substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/
          trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6pb16ZPMQpcDShjY= cache.farah:STwtDRDeIDa...
          build-users-group = nixbld
          trusted-users = root farahayyad
          experimental-features = nix-command flakes
      '';
      ```
      For more information, see the [nix.conf](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file) section of the Nix Reference Manual.
   4. Rebuild NixOS by running:
      ```sh
      sudo nixos-rebuild switch
      ```
2. Create or set the machines file:

   1. Use the following commands:
      ```sh
      cd /etc/nixos
      sudo nano machines
      ```
   2. Specify the SSH settings:

      ```
      [ssh://]USER@HOST target-spec [SSH identity file] [max-jobs] [speed factor]
      [supported-features] [mandatory-features] [ssh-public-key-encoded]
      ```

      - Parameters inside ‘[ ]’ are optional.
      - The ssh-public-key-encoded is the base-64 encoded public key of the remote machine. Get the encoding using:
        ```sh
        echo -n "your_public_key_here" | base64
        ```
      - If omitted, SSH will use its regular known_hosts file.

      For more information, see the [Remote Builds](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/advanced-topics/distributed-builds.html) section of the Nix Reference Manual.

#### 2.2. [Remote Machine] Setting Up Configuration Files

Do the following on a remote machine:

1. Specify the sshd_config settings:
   1. Use the following commands:
      ```sh
      cd /etc/ssh
      sudo nano sshd_config
      ```
   2. Make sure _PubkeyAuthentication_ is set as _yes_.
2. Specify the `/etc/nix/nix.conf` settings:
   1. Use the following commands:
      ```sh
      cd /etc/nix
      sudo nano nix.conf
      ```
   2. Edit the `nix.conf` file:
      ```
      trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:61o0gWypbMrAURk...
      build-users-group = nixbld
      require-sigs = false
      trusted-users = root farahayyad jk
      binary-caches = https://cache.nixos.org/
      substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/
      system-features = nixos-test benchmark big-parallel kvm
      binary-cache-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHD59X43...
      experimental-features = nix-command flakes
      ```
   3. Run the following command to restart daemon and update all the preceding changes:
      ```sh
      systemctl restart nix-daemon.service
      ```

## Troubleshooting

### Single-User Nix Installation Issues

This issue typically arises when Nix is installed in a single-user mode on the remote machine, which can create permission issues during multi-user operations.

If an operation fails with the following error message:

```
could not set permissions on '/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user' to 755: Operation not permitted
```

reinstall Nix in a multi-user setup:

- Uninstall Nix using a single-user mode:

  ```sh
  rm -rf /nix
  ```

- Install Nix in a multi-user mode:

  ```sh
  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
  ```

For more information about Nix security modes, see the [Security](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/nix-security) section of the Nix Reference Manual.

### VPN Setup for Remote Access

A VPN is needed, if the local machine is not on the same local network as your remote build machine.

To set up a VPN using [OpenConnect](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/), do the following:

- Install OpenConnect:

```sh
nix-env -iA nixos.openconnect
```

- Establish a VPN connection:

```sh
sudo openconnect --protocol=gp -b access.tii.ae
```

- Once authenticated, you establish a secure connection to your network. Use `ssh USER@IP_ADDRESS_OF_REMOTE_MACHINE` to check if it is possible to connect to the remote machine.

### Private Key on Local Machine Not Matching Public Key on Remote Machine

Using mismatched key pairs could result in the Permission denied error.

Ensure and double-check that you are using the right key pairs.

If you choose to use/present your local’s RSA private key, make sure that it is the corresponding RSA public key that is in the remote’s authorized_file, not the ED25519 or ECDSA public keys.
