## 1. Networking

### 1.1. PrivateNetwork

[PrivateNetwork](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=) is useful for preventing the service from accessing the network.

**Type**: _Boolean._
**Default**: `false`
**Options**:

- `true` : Creates a new network namespace for the service. Only the loopback device "lo" is available in this namespace, other network devices are not accessible.
- `false` : The service will use the host's network namespace, it can access all the network devices available on the host. It can communicate over the network like any other process running on a host.

### 1.2. IPAccounting

[IPAccounting](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html#IPAccounting=) helps in detecting unusual or unexpected network activity by a service.

**Type**: _Boolean._
**Default**: `false`
**Options**:

- `true`: Enables accounting for all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets created by the service: keeps track of the data sent and received by each socket in the service.
- `false`: Disables tracking of the sockets created by the service.

### 1.3. IPAddressAllow, IPAddressDeny

[IPAddressAllow](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html#IPAddressAllow=)=ADDRESS[/PREFIXLENGTH]…, IPAddressDeny=ADDRESS[/PREFIXLENGTH]…

Enables packet filtering on all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets created by the service. Useful for restricting/preventing a service from communicating only with certain IP addresses or networks.

**Type**: _Space separated list of ip addresses and/or a symbolic name._
**Default**: All IP addresses are allowed and no IP addresses are explicitly denied.
**Options**:

- _List of addresses_: Specify list of addresses allowed/denied. For example, `['192.168.1.8' '192.168.1.0/24']`. Any IP not explicitly allowed will be denied.
- _Symbolic Names_: Following symbolic names can also be used.
   `any` : Any host (i.e., '0.0.0.0/0 ::/0').
   `localhost`: All addresses on the local loopback (i.e., '127.0.0.0/8 ::1/128').
   `link-local`: All link-local IP addresses(i.e., '169.254.0.0/16 fe80::/64').
   `multicast`: All IP multicasting addresses (i.e., 224.0.0.0/4 ff00::/8).

### 1.4. RestrictNetworkInterfaces

[RestrictNetworkInterfaces](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html#RestrictNetworkInterfaces=) is used to control which network interfaces a service has access to. This helps isolate services from the network or restrict them to specific network interfaces, enhancing security and reducing potential risk.

**Type**: _Space-separated list of network interface names._
**Default**: The service can access to all available network interfaces unless other network restrictions are in place.
**Options**:

- Specify individual network interface names to restrict the service to using only those interfaces.
- Prefix an interface name with '~' to invert the restriction, i.e. denying access to that specific interface while allowing all others.

### 1.5. RestrictAddressFamilies

[RestrictAddressFamilies](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#RestrictAddressFamilies=) is used to control which address families a service can use. This setting restricts the service's ability to open sockets using specific address families, such as `'AF_INET'` for IPv4, `'AF_INET6'` for IPv6, or others. It is a security feature that helps limit the service's network capabilities and reduces its exposure to network-related vulnerabilities.

**Type**: List of address family names.
**Default**: If not configured, the service is allowed to use all available address families.
**Options**:

- **`none`**: Apply no restriction.
- **Specific Address Families**: Specify one or more address families that the service is allowed to use, for example, `'AF_INET'`, `'AF_INET6'`, `'AF_UNIX'`.
- **Inverted Restriction**: Prepend character '~' to an address family name to deny access to it while allowing all others, for example, `'~AF_INET'` would block IPv4 access.

## 2. File System

### 2.1 ProtectHome

[ProtectHome](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ProtectHome=) is used to restrict a service's access to home directories. This security feature can be used either completely to block access to `/home`, `/root`, and `/run/user` or make them appear empty to the service, thereby protecting user data from unauthorized access by system services.

**Type**: _Boolean or String._
**Default**: `false` i.e. the service has full access to home directories unless restricted by some other mean.
**Options**:

- **`true`**: The service is completely denied access to home directories.
- **`false`**: The service has unrestricted access to home directories.
- **`read-only`**: The service can view the contents of home directories but cannot modify them.
- **`tmpfs`**: Mounts a temporary filesystem in place of home directories, ensuring the service cannot access or modify the actual user data. Adding the tmpfs option provides a flexible approach by creating a volatile in-memory filesystem where the service believes it has access to home but any changes it makes do not affect the actual data and are lost when the service stops. This is particularly useful for services that require a temporary space in a home.

### 2.2. ProtectSystem

[ProtectSystem](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=) controls access to the system's root directory (`/`) and other essential system directories. This setting enhances security by restricting a service's ability to modify or access critical system files and directories.

**Type**: _Boolean or String._
**Default**: `full` (Equivalent to `true`). The service is restricted from modifying or accessing critical system directories.
**Options**:

- **`true`**: Mounts the directories `/usr/`, `/boot`, and `/efi` read-only for processes.
- **`full`**: Additionally mounts the `/etc/` directory read-only.
- **`strict`**: Mounts the entire file system hierarchy read-only, except for essential API file system subtrees like `/dev/`, `/proc/`, and `/sys/`.
- **`false`**: Allows the service unrestricted access to system directories.

Using `true` or `full` is recommended for services that do not require access to system directories to enhance security and stability.

### 2.3. ProtectProc

[ProtectProc](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ProtectProc=) controls access to the `/proc` filesystem for a service. This setting enhances security by restricting a service's ability to view or manipulate processes and kernel information in the `/proc` directory.

**Type**: _Boolean or String._
**Default**: `default`. No restriction is imposed from viewing or manipulating processes and kernel information in `/proc`.
**Options**:

- **`noaccess`**: Restricts access to most process metadata of other users in `/proc`.
- **`invisible`**: Hides processes owned by other users from view in `/proc`.
- **`ptraceable`**: Hides processes that cannot be traced (`ptrace()`) by other processes.
- **`default`**: Imposes no restrictions on access or visibility to `/proc`.

### 2.4. ReadWritePaths, ReadOnlyPaths, InaccessiblePaths, ExecPaths, NoExecPaths

[ReadWritePaths](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ReadWritePaths=) creates a new file system namespace for executed processes, enabling fine-grained control over file system access.

- **ReadWritePaths=**: Paths listed here are accessible with the same access modes from within the namespace as from outside it.
- **ReadOnlyPaths=**: Allows reading from listed paths only; write attempts are refused even if file access controls would otherwise permit it.
- **InaccessiblePaths=**: Makes listed paths and everything below them in the file system hierarchy inaccessible to processes within the namespace.
- **NoExecPaths=**: Prevents execution of files from listed paths, overriding usual file access controls. Nest `ExecPaths=` within `NoExecPaths=` to selectively allow execution within directories otherwise marked non-executable.

**Type**: _Space-separated list of paths._
**Default**: No restriction to file system access until unless restricted by some other mechanism.
**Options**:
**Space separated list of paths** : Space-separated list of paths relative to the host's root directory. Symlinks are resolved relative to the root directory specified by `RootDirectory=` or `RootImage=`.

### 2.5. PrivateTmp

[PrivateTmp](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=) uses a private, isolated `/tmp` directory for the service, enhancing security by preventing access to other processes' temporary files and ensuring data isolation.

**Type**: _Boolean._
**Default**: `false`. If not specified, the service shares the system `/tmp` directory with other processes.
**Options**:

- **`true`**: Enables private `/tmp` for the service, isolating its temporary files from other processes.
- **`false`**: The service shares the system `/tmp` directory with other processes.

Additionally, when enabled, all temporary files created by a service in these directories will be automatically removed after the service is stopped.

### 2.6. PrivateMounts

[PrivateMounts](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#PrivateMounts=) controls whether the service should have its mount namespace, isolating its mounts from the rest of the system. This setup ensures that any file system mount points created or removed by the unit's processes remain private to them and are not visible to the host.

**Type**: _Boolean._
**Default**: `false`. If not specified, the service shares the same mount namespace as other processes.
**Options**:

- **`true`**: Enables private mount namespace for the service, isolating its mounts from the rest of the system.
- **`false`**: The service shares the same mount namespace as other processes.

### 2.7. ProcSubset

[ProcSubset](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ProcSubset=) restricts the set of `/proc` entries visible to the service, enhancing security by limiting access to specific process information in the `/proc` filesystem.

**Type**: _String._
**Default**: `all`. If not specified, the service has access to all `/proc` entries.
**Options**:

- **`all`**: Allows the service access to all `/proc` entries.
- **`pid`**: Restricts the service to only its own process information (`/proc/self`, `/proc/thread-self/`).

### 3.2. DynamicUser

[DynamicUser](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#DynamicUser=) enables systemd to dynamically allocate a unique user and group ID (UID/GID) for the service at runtime, enhancing security and resource isolation. These user and group entries are managed transiently during runtime and are not added to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`.

**Type**: _Boolean._
**Default**: `false`. If not specified, the service uses a static user and group ID defined in the service unit file or defaults to `root`.
**Options**:

- **`true`**: A UNIX user and group pair are dynamically allocated when the unit is started and released as soon as it is stopped.
- **`false`**: The service uses a static UID/GID defined in the service unit file or defaults to `root`.

## 8. System Calls

### 8.1. SystemCallFilter

[SystemCallFilter](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#SystemCallFilter=) specifies a system call filter for the service, restricting the types of system calls that processes within the service can make.

**Type**: _Space-separated list of system calls._
**Default**: If not explicitly specified, there are no restrictions imposed by systemd on system calls.
**Options**:

- _List of system calls_: Specifies the allowed system calls for processes within the service. If the list begins with "~", the effect is inverted, meaning only the listed system calls will result in termination.

<Aside type="tip">
  Predefined sets of system calls are available, starting with "@" followed by the name of the set.
