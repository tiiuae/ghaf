## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Scenarios

<Aside>
The following examples represent only the local WireGuard GUI configuration. Peer-side configurations are not included.
</Aside>

### 1. Split-tunnel VPN as client
Use this configuration if you want only specific traffic to pass through the VPN tunnel, while other traffic goes through your normal network connection.
![Wireguard split tunnelling configuration](@assets/ghaf/wireguard_split_tunnelling_cfg.png)

You can try to ping: ```ping 10.10.10.0```

### 2. Full-tunnel VPN as client
Use this mode if you want all network traffic to be routed through the VPN tunnel for maximum privacy and encryption.
![Wireguard full tunnelling configuration](@assets/ghaf/wireguard_full_tunelling.png)

You can run ```curl ifconfig.me``` command and response should be vpn server's public IP. For our case it should be ```1.2.3.4```

### 3. VPN as server
Configure WireGuard as a server to accept connections from multiple clients.

You can try to ping: ```ping 10.10.10.0```

<Aside>
- You can use an IP calculator to help generate correct `AllowedIPs` values: [WireGuard AllowedIPs Calculator](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/)
