## Design Principles

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Edge security" icon="up-caret">
    The Ghaf security architecture under development by SSRC aims to provide an
    understandable yet comprehensive view of security controls in the Platform
    so that vendors can make informed decisions and adopt the Platform for their
    use cases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero trust" icon="magnifier">
    The Ghaf Platform aims to apply the general security principles of zero
    trust within the software architecture and to act as an enabler for ZTA for
    edge devices within organizations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trusted computing Base" icon="laptop">
    The general principle for establishing the trusted Ghaf Platform code base
    is to rely on audited software and proven security modules while carefully
    evaluating and integrating new concepts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configurable, declarative & reproducible" icon="document">
    Powered by Nix, system can be declared and reproduced bit-by-bit. Learn
    more.
