# TII SSRC Secure Technologies: Ghaf Framework

_[Ghaf Framework](./appendices/glossary.md#ghaf)_ is an open-source project that provides information about our work and studies in the security technologies field in the context of embedded virtualization.

The applied software research supports _[Secure Systems Research Center](./appendices/glossary.md#ssrc)_ focus areas.

## Embedded Virtualization

Embedded virtualization builds on cloud technologies in the development of end-to-end security. With hardware support for virtualization, we provide a hardened system of a small trusted computing base (TCB)—thin host—that enables isolation of use cases and their resources. Use cases are protected in guest virtual machines (VMs). Embedded targets are small devices (personal or headless) instead of high-performance cloud servers. Our scope is illustrated in the following diagram. For more information, see [stack](architecture/stack.md).

If you are interested in why we do something *this* way instead of *that* way, see [Architecture Decision Records](adr.md).

## Reference Implementation

Ghaf is developing a reference implementation for NVIDIA Jetson devices.
Ghaf also supports NXP's i.MX8QuadMax-MEK development board along with generic-x86 devices. See [build instructions](build_config/reference_implementations.md) for more information.
