# TII SSRC Secure Technologies: Ghaf Framework

Secure Tech-project studies secure technologies in the context of embedded virtualization. This documentation-project, named after Ghaf tree, provides a landing site to our work. Our applied software research supports [Secure Systems Research Center](https://www.tii.ae/secure-systems) focus areas.

## Embedded Virtualization

Embedded virtualization builds on cloud technologies in the development of end-to-end security. With hardware support for virtualization, we provide hardened system of small trusted computing base (TCB) - thin host - that enables isolation of use cases and their resources. Use cases are protected in guest virtual machines. Embedded targets small devices - personal or headless - instead of high performance cloud servers. Our scope is illustrated in the following diagram.

## Reference Implementation

Ghaf is developing a reference implementation for NVIDIA Jetson devices. See [build instructions](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/#build-instructions) for more info.
Legacy reference implementation for NXP i.MX8 [is available here](https://github.com/tiiuae/spectrum-config-imx8).
