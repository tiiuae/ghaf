# Running Windows 11 in VM on Ghaf

You can run Windows 11 in a VM on Ghaf with NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. This method uses [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) as VMM. For information on how to build and run a Ghaf image for NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX, see [Build and Run](../ref_impl/build_and_run.md#ghaf-image-for-nvidia-jetson-orin-agx).


## Getting Windows 11 Image

1. Use your Microsoft account to join the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/register) to be able to install Windows Insider Preview Builds.
2. On the *Windows 11 on Arm Insider Preview* page, select the `Windows 11 Client Arm64 Insider Preview (Canary) - Build 25324` build and the language to download a VHDX image file for ARM64.
3. Copy *Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_25324.VHDX* to an external USB drive. Connect the USB drive to the NVIDIA device with the latest version of Ghaf installed, and mount it to some folder.

    ```
    sudo mkdir /mnt
    sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt
    ```
    > **WARNING:** Make sure to use a fresh VHDX image file which has not been booted on some other environment before.


## Running Windows 11 in VM

1. In Weston terminal, go to the directory with the VHDX image and run the VM using the following Ghaf script:

    ```
    cd /mnt
    windows-launcher ./Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_25324.VHDX
    ```

    > **WARNING:** Do not use **sudo** or the root user to run windows-launcher.

    Alternatively, you can launch the Windows 11 VM by clicking the corresponding icon in the Weston taskbar.

    When you click it for the first time, you will see a file selection dialog. Once Windows 11 image has been selected, it saves the path to the `~/.config/windows-launcher-ui.conf` configuration file and launches the VM. Next time, the VM will be immediately launched with one click.

2. You can pass additional parameter to QEMU after the image name. For example:

   ```
   windows-launcher ./Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_25324.VHDX -serial stdio
   ```

3. Windows 11 requires Internet access to finish the setup. To boot the VM without an Internet connection, open cmd with Shift+F10 and type `OOBE\BYPASSNRO`. The VM will reboot and configuration will continue in offline mode.
