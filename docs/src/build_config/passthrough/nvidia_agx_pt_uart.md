# NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin: UART Passthrough

This document describes the UART passthrough implementations on the NVIDIA Jetson 
AGX Orin board. The goal of this document is to guide more complex devices 
passthrough implementations.

## UART Connections

There are eight UART units in the System on Chip (SoC) plus two Server Base System 
Architecture (SBSA) UART units. The SoC UART units are named with an alphabetical 
suffix: UARTA, UARTB, UARTC, UARTD, UARTE, UARTF, UARTG, UARTH (which may be referred 
to as UART1, UART2, UART3, UART4, UART5, UART6, UART7, and UART8). The SBRA UART units 
are named UARTI and UARTJ. These units are pin-muxed with the UARTE and UARTC 
respectively.

The following table describes the UART units mapping and connections. The first 
column shows how the UART units are defined on the UART device tree file
*tegra234-soc-uart.dtsi*[^note1]. The second and third columns show the CPU and
SoC pin connections. Note here that for UART2 and UART5 these are swapped. 
The pin mapping configuration is described on the file
*tegra234-mb1-bct-pinmux-p3701-0000.dtsi*[^note2]. This device tree file is 
automatically generated by the macro Excel file 
*Jetson_AGX_Orin_Series_Pinmux_Config_Template_1.5.xlsm* which is available 
the official Jetson Download Center as the *Jetson AGX Orin Series Pinmux*. Finally, 
the last column describes where the UART units are connected to the exterior.

| **Device tree def.**  |  **CPU pin** | **SoC pin** | **Connected to**            |
|-----------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|-----------------------------|
| uarta: serial@3100000 |     UART1    |    UART1    | 40 pin header 3v3           |
| uartb: serial@3110000 |     UART2    |    UART5    | M.2 key E (WiFi card)       |
| uartc: serial@c280000 |     UART3    |    UART3    | USB Debug ttyACM0           |
| uartd: serial@3130000 |     UART4    |    UART4    | Camera connector            |
| uarte: serial@3140000 |  Not mapped  |             |                             |
| uartf: serial@3150000 |  Not mapped  |             |                             |
| uartg: not on dtb     |     UART7    |    UART7    | Optional, USB Debug ttyACM1 |
| uarth: serial@3170000 |  Not mapped  |             |                             |
| uarti: serial@31d0000 |     UART5    |    UART2    | USB Debug ttyACM1           |
| uartj: serial@c270000 |  Not mapped  |             |                             |

Please note here that only two UART units are connected to the micro USB debug
interface. The UART7 is not connected by default, but it can be connected to the 
debug interface ttyACM1 by swapping the fuse resistors (see Debug MCU page 7 on 
P3737_A04_Concept_schematics.pdf [^note3])


## UARTI Selected for Passthrough

The UARTI unit was selected to do the first "Hello world" passthrough implementation.
This is because the UARTI does not show any dependencies on its device tree as shown
below:

```cpp
	uarti: serial@31d0000 {
		compatible = "arm,sbsa-uart";
		reg = <0x0 0x31d0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 TEGRA234_IRQ_UARTI 0x04>;
		current-speed = <115200>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
```


## Host Device Tree

To prepare the UARTI on the host for the passthrough, you need to modify the UARTI 
node in the tegra234-soc-uart.dtsi device tree file [^note1] as follows:

```cpp
	uarti: serial@31d0000 {
		compatible = "arm,dummy";
		iommus = <&smmu_niso0 TEGRA_SID_NISO1_SMMU_TEST>;
		reg = <0x0 0x31d0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 TEGRA234_IRQ_UARTI 0x04>;
		current-speed = <115200>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
```

The modifications includes:

1. **compatible:** put a dummy driver associated to this node, in this way the
   kernel will not bind any driver to this UART unit.

2. **iommus:** add the iommus field with the test stream ID *TEGRA_SID_NISO1_SMMU_TEST*
   which by default is not used by any other device.

After include these modifications, compile the kernel to update the output DTB and 
then flash it to the internal eMMC device tree A and B partitions with the following 
command:

    dd if=./arch/arm64/boot/dts/nvidia/tegra234-p3701-0000-p3737-0000.dtb of=/dev/mmcblk0p3
    dd if=./arch/arm64/boot/dts/nvidia/tegra234-p3701-0000-p3737-0000.dtb of=/dev/mmcblk0p6


## Guest Device Tree

The guest device tree is based on the device tree extracted from QEMU VM. 
To get the base QEMU device tree you can run the following command:

    qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt,accel=kvm,dumpdtb=virt.dtb -cpu host

To this device tree add the passthrough devices inside the platform node:


```cpp
	platform@c000000 {
		interrupt-parent = <0x8001>;
		ranges = <0xc000000 0x00 0xc000000 0x2000000>;
		#address-cells = <0x01>;
		#size-cells = <0x01>;
		compatible = "qemu,platform\0simple-bus";

		uarti: serial@c000000 {
		    compatible = "arm,sbsa-uart";
		    current-speed = <0x1c200>;
		    interrupts = <0x00 0x70 0x04>;
		    reg = <0x0c000000 0x10000>;
		    status = "okay";
        	};
	};
```

Here, the *uarti* node was added to the platform node. To this node, the interrupt 
number was replaced to 0x70 and reg address to the one that was obtained from the 
QEMU monitor command: *info mtree -f*


## Start Guest VM

To start the Guest VM first we need to bind the UARTI to the VFIO driver. The VFIO 
allows the user-level can access to the devices, in this case, QEMU. To do this run 
the following commands:

    echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/31d0000.serial/driver_override
    echo 31d0000.serial > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/vfio-platform/bind

Before start the Guest VM, connect the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin Debug USB to your PC, and 
open the serial port ttyACM1 at 115200 bps. You can use picocom with the next
command:

    picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM1

Then run the Guest VM with the following QEMU command:

    qemu-system-aarch64 \
        -nographic \
        -machine virt,accel=kvm \
        -cpu host \
        -m 1024 \
        -no-reboot \
        -kernel Image \
        -drive file=focal-server-cloudimg-arm64.raw,if=virtio,format=raw \
        -device vfio-platform,host=31d0000.serial\
        -dtb uart.dtb \
        -append "rootwait root=/dev/vda1 console=ttyAMA0"

After the Guest VM is launched you can see the VM Linux command line in the opened
ttyACM1 terminal.
