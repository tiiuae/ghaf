# About Ghaf

Secure Tech-project studies secure technologies in the context of embedded virtualization. This documentation-project, named after Ghaf tree, provides a landing site to our work. Our applied software research supports [Secure Systems Research Center](https://www.tii.ae/secure-systems) focus areas.

## Embedded Virtualization

Embedded virtualization builds on cloud technologies in the development of end-to-end security. With hardware support for virtualization, we provide hardened system of small trusted computing base (TCB) - thin host - that enables isolation of use cases and their resources. Use cases are protected in guest virtual machines. Embedded targets small devices - personal or headless - instead of high performance cloud servers. Our scope is illustrated in the following diagram.

## Reference Implementation

Our work in progress reference implementation on NXP i.MX 8 is available [here](https://github.com/tiiuae/spectrum-config-imx8).
