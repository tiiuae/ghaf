# Decision record template
<!-- based on simple template by Michael Nygard - https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md -->

This is the template for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:


# Title

## Status

What is the status: proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?


## Context

What is the issue that we are seeing that is motivating this decision or change?


## Decision

What is the change that we are proposing and/or doing?


## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
