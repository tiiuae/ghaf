# Architecture Decision Records

Architecturally significant decisions are recorded as [architecture decision records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io).

The Ghaf platform decision log:

| Decision Record | Status |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Minimal Host](../architecture/adr/minimal-host.md) | Proposed. |
| [netvm—Networking Virtual Machine](../architecture/adr/netvm.md) | Proposed, partially implemented for development and testing. |
| [Platform Bus for RustVMM](../architecture/adr/platform-bus-passthrough-support.md) | Proposed, WIP. |


To create an architectural decision proposal, open [a pull request](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-documentation) and use the [decision record template](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/blob/main/docs/src/architecture/adr/template.md). Contributions to the Ghaf architecture decisions are welcome.
